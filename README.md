**Results:**  I learned the following:
        + Basic setup
        + Basic architecture of Jekyll website
        + Run server while using Jekyll
        + Main differences between Rails and Jekyll (lack of database)
---
**Blocks:** None, easy to follow. Highly recommended for anyone getting started using Ruby and also looking to create a very basic website.
---
**Lessons:** This might be a good choice for someone doing something basic and that does not need a database on the back end. The responsiveness be valuable to small business that do not need much in the way of features. It would be good, quick, and light for small businesses or organizations that just need a basic landing page. However, it may prove to be difficult to use for someone that is unfamiliar with coding and/or is used to the cms features that are part of the Wordpress infrastructure.
